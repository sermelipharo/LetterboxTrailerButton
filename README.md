# LetterboxTrailerButton
The Letterboxd Visible Trailer Button userscript enhances the user experience on Letterboxd by making the trailer link more visible and accessible. I realized that many users might not even know that trailers are available on the site, so I created this script to make the trailer button more prominent and aligned with the UX of other platforms.
